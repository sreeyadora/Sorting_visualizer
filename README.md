## 📌 Description

This project visualizes how popular sorting algorithms work.  
Each element is represented as a vertical bar whose height reflects its value.

### 🔍 Color Codes
- 🔴 **Red** – Elements being swapped
- 🔵 **Blue** – Elements being compared
- 🟢 **Green** – Element is in its final sorted position

The app also measures and displays the time taken by different algorithms.
